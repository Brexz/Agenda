# Agenda
This is a project where I made an agenda, that consist in 3 contact fields. I made it with Python, JavaScript and a framework that it's called Flask.

In this project you can add, modify, delete and seach for contacts. It's an application that works in a localserver, in this case I used WAMP, setting the port 3000.

This is the view of the main page, were you can find the components to interact and control the data of the contacts.

For example, you can add a new contact by filling the fields and presing the "Agregar" button. You can put the name, telephone number and an email to create the contact

Once you have add the contact, it notify you that you have added it successfuly.

Another action that you can do, it's modify an existing contact. 
What you need to do it's press the button in the corresponding contact, and it will show the form to modify the contact, 
there you can modify the field that you want, and then, you have to press the "Modificar" button.

And it will notify you that the action was successful.

As well, you can search for an specific contact and it will appear in the main table.
All you need to do it's searching by the name of the contact in the corresponding field.
In this case, I'm  going to search the name "Brayan de la Torre" and pressing the "buscar" button, and it will appear in the table.

Sorry for the parts that it shows in Spanish, I made this project when I was in school.
